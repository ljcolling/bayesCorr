\title{Estimate the correlation parameter of a bi-variate normal}
\usage{
cor.test(x,y,method = "mcmc")
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{numeric vectors of data values. `x` and `y` must have the same length}
}
\description{
This function estimates the rho parameter for bivariate normal using
MCMC. It use a very wide prior on the mean (normal) and sd (uniform) for the marginals.
}
\details{
It is used in the same way at the base cor.test function except with settting
method to "mcmc"
}
\examples{
## Hollander & Wolfe (1973), p. 187f.
## Assessment of tuna quality.  We compare the Hunter L measure of
##  lightness to the averages of consumer panel scores (recoded as
##  integer values from 1 to 6 and averaged over 80 such values) in
##  9 lots of canned tuna.
x <- c(44.4, 45.9, 41.9, 53.3, 44.7, 44.1, 50.7, 45.2, 60.1)
y <- c( 2.6,  3.1,  2.5,  5.0,  3.6,  4.0,  5.2,  2.8,  3.8)
##  The alternative hypothesis of interest is that the
##  Hunter L value is positively associated with the panel score.
